# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I have learned sooo much in the past week. I'm really grasping everything but still slow in applying many of the concepts. I am very impressed with my peers and everyone at codeworks, but I'm also somewhat intimidated. Right now I'm mostly struggling with what the different syntaxes and symbols you use to conjure or establish CSS styles are and when it is most appropriate to use certain ones. Often when I see things applied in lecture I feel as though I am following along and understand everything perfectly, however when it comes time to utilize certain styles or tags on my own I draw a blank for a second and need to reference an example. It's all making more sense the more I practice. Code that looked like gibberish to me only a week ago is becoming accessible. I can feel my power growing and I'm really starting to enjoy the process of coding both of which I'd count as major victories.
