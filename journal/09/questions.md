> Inheritance is a process that enables a class to "inherit" or adopt the attributes, methods and properties of another class.

> The singleton design pattern limits the "instantiation of a class" such that it ensures that only one instance of a class exists on the "Javascript Virtual Machine" at a time.

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> The 'Observer' design pattern is a pattern with a one to many dependency between objects such that when the state of one object changes all of its dependents are automatically notified.

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> The 'Strategy' design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows for the selection of algorithm dynamically at based on runtime.

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> The 'Factory' design pattern is a creational pattern that provides structure for objects in a superclass, while simultaneously allowing for subclasses to change the object types that can be created.

06. What is test driven development?

> Test driven development is a software development process in which tests are written and run before the implementation code.

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> The DoD or 'definition of done' represents a Scrum team's shared understanding regarding precise criteria that must be met in order for a product backlog item or increment to be considered complete and shippable.

08. Give two examples of a user story:

> As a user of this social media app, I want to be able to customize my feed based on my interests, so that I can more easily and quickly have access to information I want to see. As Zac, I want to get as many of my friends and family to be a part of this new social network, so that the experience becomes more dynamic and engaging for us all.

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> The Sprint Backlog is created during the sprint planning stage of Scrum.

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?

> I believe this occurs during the Daily Scrum AKA Daily Standup meeting.
