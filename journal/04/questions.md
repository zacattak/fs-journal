# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > Asynchronous code is code that runs independent of other instructions whereas synchronous code is dependent upon the sequence of instructions and executes one task at a time in order.

02. What is an event listener?

  > An even listener waits or "listens" for a browser even to occur, and then executes a corresponding function.

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > Rest stands for Representation State Transfer and they are a popular form of API. REST refers to an architecture that sets the rules for how an API works.

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > The higher order function takes one or more functions as arguments, and or returns a function as a result whereas a callback function refers to a function that's passed as an argument to another function.

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > In javascript a promise is an object that occupies one of three states: pending, resolved, and rejected.

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > Some of the most common HTTP methods include GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > API stands for Application Programming Interface.

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > If a promise is passed to an 'await', it pauses the execution of the surrounding async function that it is within until the promise is resolved. 

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > Encapsulation restricts direct access to values or the state of an object 

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > A 2xx successful code means that the request was successful, like the 200 OK status code cat.

11. What is a 400 error?

  >The 400 error code indicates that the server cannot process the request as the result of a perceived client error.
