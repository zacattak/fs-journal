# Managing the Fullstack Application

1. Describe the two ways to bind Data in Vue?

  > Using the v-model Vue enables "two way data binding" from the data to the view and the view to the data. Vue also allows for text interpolation to directly bind and display data.

2. The `SPA` acronym stands for what?

  > 'SPA' stands for "Single Page Application".

3. What are some of the advantages/uses of a `SPA` over a traditional one?

  > A 'SPA' loads a single page and renders the javascript code directly in the browser. As a result these types of websites generally have higher responsiveness and reactivity.

4. What does the `onMounted` method in Vue do?

  > OnMounted in vue effectively hitches specific actions to the lifecycle of the webpage (refresh).

5. What is the `v-model` attribute in Vue for, and when might you use it?

  > V-model is a particularly powerful tool vue employs that allows for two way data binding between values in our template as well as data.

6. What is the package.json file used for?

  > It's primary function is to manage any and all dependencies that may or may not be required for and/or missing from your project.

7. Which Vue attributes(directives) could you use to conditionally render elements on a page?

  > v-if is excellent for conditionally rendering elements in that it only renders if the specified condition is true, while v-show is another method that instead changes the visibility of the element instead of stopping it from rendering entirely.

8. What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when using `v-for` on an element?

  > They 'key' attribute referenced when 'v-for'ing on an element assists in generating a new filtered list based on the property of the key value.

9. What is the `<slot>` element and what is it used for?

  > <slot> assists us in that it takes what can be conceptualized as a "slot" of code and effectively "slots" that code in somewhere else in our application.
